This is a project for learning vue 2. Here I am not trying to make code look good.

# vue-cli

> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

# Backend:

`cd backend`

See commands in makefile like:
`make init`
`make start`
